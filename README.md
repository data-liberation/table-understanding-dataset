table understanding dataset for  comparative evaluation of different table understanding algorithms



The problem of table understanding has attracted much interest in previous years from the database as well as the document engineering communities. On the Web, discovering structured data is a tremendous challenge and PDF documents represent the most common document format after HTML. It is commonly recognized that table understanding consists of three tasks of increasing complexity:     

* table detection: locating the regions of a document with tabular content;        

* table structure recognition: reconstructing the cellular structure of a table;          

* table interpretation: rediscovering the meaning of the tabular structure. This includes:         

  (a) functional analysis: determining the function of cells and their abstract logical relationships;       

  (b) semantic interpretation: understanding the semantics of the table in terms of the entities represented in the table, their attributes, and the mutual relationships between such entities.
